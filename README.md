# Showcase
This is a repository of projects I have worked on both through Thinkful and on my own.

After several years in market research Sales & Consulting I was ready for a new career. I always had an interest in learning to code, and in choosing the right language I wanted to be able to tie it back to my experience with data and helping companies generate insights. After a few months of teaching myself Python(and generous help from my friend Ryan who is a Python developer) I enrolled in the Thinkful Data Science Bootcamp to gain a better understanding of the relationship between programming, data science and analytics. 

This Repository is to display projects I have worked on both for Thinkful projects as well as my own interests. Learning both the coding side like Python and SQL has been both enjoyable and rewarding and being able to apply it when learning concepts like machine learning is something I hope to turn into a career.
